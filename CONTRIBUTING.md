In this article, you will learn step by step how to create a page and modify it to become a real contributor to this Wiki. She will explain the basics and some useful tips to get you started.

## How to Edit a Wiki Page

### File Selection

Go to the Wiki's GitHub page and choose the file you want to edit from the list.

## Start Editing
Click on the small pencil logo (Edit), GitHub will then automatically create a "Fork" in your profile, which will allow you to modify the document.

## Validate the modification and comment it
After making your changes, be sure to format it with Markdown, you will find a help box below; then add a comment that precisely explains your changes; you must indicate your sources if you have any.

Finally, validate by pressing the "Propose changes" button which will confirm the action.

## Verification and posting
This is the last time you will see your text! Read it one last time.

Once you are sure of the content, click on "Create pull request".

## Creation of the Pull Request
Here you can last change the title and add comment. Check if it is complete and if possible sourced (an English Discord support article for example).

Then to finish your work, click on "Create pull request".

Caution! You must leave the "Allow edits by maintainers" box checked to allow us to correct faults or simply allow us to add the necessary tags so that the quantum hamsters on our website can work!

## Team Verification
If you land on the next page, you have nothing more to do, the Yloh staff and experienced contributors will review your modification.
